<h2><strong>Why is it necessary to Compare Auto&nbsp;Insurance Policies?</strong></h2>
</div>
<p class="paragraphBu">It is necessary to compare the auto&nbsp;insurance policies as it can save a substantial amount of money and give you better coverage options. However, comparing the policies manually can be a daunting task. Policy Bazaar makes it fairly easy for you.

Compare online and know your auto&nbsp;insurance plan properly before buying.</p>
<p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Shortlist the Requirement for Your Coverage:</strong> Before digging into comparing different auto insurance plans, ascertain the kind of coverage you need. A liability policy is inexpensive than the comprehensive auto&nbsp;insurance policy but only if you are ready to compromise on some benefits because the facilities offered by the later is the best undoubtedly.</p>
<p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Compared the coverage Option:</strong> The coverage offered in liability policy differs from the comprehensive policy. While liability plan only covers third party liability, the comprehensive one covers you for the damages to the vehicle and the owner which is called as Personal Accident Cover. The limit varies from plans to plan. Moreover, additional add-on benefits are also offered by some auto insurance plans. So, it is necessary to check and compare this trait to decide the personal accidental cover along with the additional coverage, if any under the same auto&nbsp;insurance plan.</p>
<p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Compare the Insured Declare Value:</strong>&nbsp;The varied rate of IDV's reflects different rates of premiums. Insured Declared Value, abbreviated as IDV, is the current value of the car after being adjusted for appropriate reduction. The rate of depreciation depends on the age of your car. Older the car, higher would be the depreciation and lowered would be your IDV. And it affects the Sum Assured. Hence, compare the IDV quoted offered by different car insurance plans is a must.</p>
<p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Compare Insurer's Claim Settlement Practice:</strong> Claim settlement is the most crucial part of an insurance policy. Every buyer expects a hassle free claim process and easiness of any car insurance policy which he is planning to invest in. Each insurance company has its own procedure. Hereby, it is essential to compare the claim settlement process of each auto insurance plan which is in your preference list to find out which type of rules best suits you and would enable a faster claim settlement.</p>

<h2><strong>Coverage under Car Insurance</strong></h2>
</div>
<p class="paragraphBu"><strong>There are primarily 3 types of Car Insurance -</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Third Party Liability Coverage</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu"><a href="https://www.policybazaar.com/motor-insurance/third-party-insurance/?utm_source=organic" target="_blank" rel="alternate noopener noreferrer">Third Party car insurance</a> provides cover against any legal liability to a third party caused when you are at-fault driver. It covers damage/injury caused by you to another person/property. A Third Party Liability cover is legally mandatory in India under the Motor Vehicles Act.</p>
<h3><strong>Collision Coverage</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">Collision coverage protects the insured financially against damage of their own car. It pays the insured for damage caused by collision which is usually an accident. Damage or loss due to theft or vandalism is not included in collision coverage.</p>
<h3><strong>Comprehensive Coverage</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">A comprehensive coverage is extensive and includes damage of car, theft of vehicle, third party legal liability and personal accident cover. The policy coverage can be further extended by opting for add-ons like accessories cover, engine protector, zero depreciation cover, medical expenses, etc. This type of coverage is the most popular as it offers end-to-end coverage and thus less stress for the policyholder.</p>

<h2><strong>Customize Your Auto Insurance Policy with Additional Coverage</strong></h2>
</div>
<h3><strong>No Claim Bonus</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">For every claim free year, the insured is rewarded with discount on the renewal premium. This discount is called - No Claim Bonus (NCB). It is cumulative and increases, every year. It usually ranges from 10% to 50% and can save a substantial amount of money on the premium payable for your auto insurance. Let's take an example, if a policyholder doesn't make a claim during the tenure of his auto insurance policy, he becomes eligible for No Claim Bonus, on the basis of which, a certain rebate is offered on the payable premium.</p>

<h3><strong>Personal Accident Riders</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">Personal Accident Rider is an optional add-on benefit that can be added to the comprehensive auto insurance by paying an extra premium. This rider provides the policyholder with the coverage of medical expenses due to a damage, personal injury or disability caused due to an accident.</p>
<h3><strong>Cover for Car Accessories</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">By simply opting for separate add-on policy, you can avail the coverage for your car accessories, which a normal car insurance policy may not cover. Such additions may increase the premium, but it is always beneficial and cost-effective rather fitting a new car accessory.</p>
<h3><strong>Save Through Paying High Deductibles</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">A policyholder can save by paying higher deductibles. At the time of filing a claim, if you choose to pay higher deductibles against your claim, your auto insurance provider manages to give you some discount on premium later on.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What is not covered in Car Insurance?</strong></h2>
</div>
<p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Following features are usually not covered in car insurance:</strong></p>
<ul class="data_ul">

<h2><strong>Get Discounts, Save Money, Buy Smart</strong></h2>
</div>
<p class="paragraphBu">A smart customer is in a constant hunt for discounts which will reduce the burden on his pocket. If you are one among them then here are a few tips that will help you get discount and save money on premium value of your car insurance.</p>
<h3><strong>Voluntary Access</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">Voluntary deductible is the minimum amount that you declare to bear at the time of claim. The higher deductible you opt for, the lower will be your premium. Simply put it means that the financial burden on the insurance provider is less and you will also chip in when an accident or car damage happens.</p>
<h3><strong>Anti-theft Discount</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">In case your car is fitted with an ARAI approved anti theft device, your insurer will offer additional discount (2.5% on the OD Premium). This discount is provided for the simple reason that an anti-theft device will make your car less liable to theft.</p>
<h3><strong>Privilege Membership</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">Members of the Automobile Association and some Professionals (Defense Personnel, Doctors and Govt. Employees) are entitled to get additional discount on their premium. So, never miss out to mention the same while searching for a quote.</p>
<p class="paragraphBu">While getting quotes for your vehicle at Policy Bazaar, you might see for yourself how changing even minor details make a huge difference to the final calculated premium. For example, take the case of Dr. Gupta. He's a doctor by profession and needs car insurance for his brand new Renault Duster. His car is fitted with an ARAI approved anti-theft kit. While getting a car insurance quote, he neither mentions his profession nor the fact that his car is fitted with an anti-theft kit. Thus he ends up paying a higher premium. On the contrary, if he did mention about these then, needless to say, his premium could have been lower by 25%.</p>
